I’m **Daffa**, a *self-taught programmer* from **Indonesia** 🇮🇩 with over **5 years** of experience in the field.

I started **programming** while I was still in **madrasah aliyah** 🏫 — so the trigger was actually **my own interest**, not college.

I’ve experimented with a **wide range of technologies** ⚙️ — including *React*, *Flutter*, *React Native*, *Svelte*, *Express*, *Python*, *FastAPI*, *Firebase*, *MongoDB*, *PostgreSQL*, **and more**.

My journey is driven by **self-learning**, **curiosity**, and a **commitment to continuous growth** 🚀
