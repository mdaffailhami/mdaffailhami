## Hi, I’m **Daffa Ilhami** 👋

I’m a **self-taught programmer** from **Indonesia** 🇮🇩 with over **5 years** of experience in the field.

I started **programming** while I was still in **madrasah aliyah** 🏫 — so the trigger was actually **my own interest**, not college.

I’ve experimented with a **wide range of technologies** ⚙️ — including *React*, *Flutter*, *React Native*, *Svelte*, *Express*, *FastAPI*, *Firebase*, *MongoDB*, *PostgreSQL*, **and more**.

I’ve taught myself **various skills** 📚 over the years, and every day brings a new opportunity to *explore*, *create*, and *push the limits of what I know*.

---

My journey is driven by **self-learning**, **curiosity**, and a **commitment to continuous growth** 🚀

---

Here are some of the **technologies** that I use:
