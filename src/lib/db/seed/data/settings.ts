I’m **Daffa**, a **Fullstack Programmer (frontend & backend generalist)** from Indonesia 🇮🇩 with **5+ years of hands-on coding experience**, building projects across *personal, community, and freelance* work.

I started programming back in *madrasah aliyah* 🏫, driven purely by **curiosity** and **self-learning**, long before college became part of the story.

Over the years, I’ve worked with a wide range of technologies ⚙️, and today I focus mainly on fullstack frameworks, especially **SvelteKit**, to ship web apps _end-to-end_.

I’m used to building **clean, responsive UI** across different screen sizes, integrating **databases and APIs**, deploying to production, and collaborating with solid **Git workflows** 🚀

Here are some of the **technologies** I use:
