### Hi I’m Daffa Ilhami 👋

I'm a _self-taught programmer_ from **Indonesia** 🇮🇩 with over **5 years** of experience in the field.

I started **programming** while I was still in **madrasah aliyah** 🏫 — so the trigger was actually **my own interest**, not college.

I’ve experimented with a **wide range of technologies** ⚙️ — including _React_, _Flutter_, _React Native_, _Svelte_, _Express_, _Python_, _FastAPI_, _Firebase_, _MongoDB_, _PostgreSQL_, **and more**.

My journey is driven by **self-learning**, **curiosity**, and a **commitment to continuous growth** 🚀
